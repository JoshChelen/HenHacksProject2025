## Inspiration:
As students, we often need to do additional learning outside of the classroom, and a main form of this comes from watching videos. But while we can pull up a video and take notes side by side, it lacks some convenience that would greatly help student productivity. 

That's where **YouNote** comes in, providing a simple interface and much-needed functionality, which makes the whole process easier and more effective. 

## What It Does:
-Take notes side-by-side with the video you are watching.

-Save, organize, and assign notes to videos.

-Separate notes by timestamps that link back to those points in the video.

## How We Built It:
We built YouNote using the Unity Game Engine. Unity has plenty of features that allowed us to create and adjust elements in the application as needed. Additionally, we use Git for efficient collaboration with team members and its straightforward implementation with Unity.

## Challenges We Ran Into:
The biggest challenge we encountered was the general inexperience with Unity that our team had. It required us to search plenty of documentation to only fix a small bug in our code.

## What's Next for YouNote:
-Implementation as a Google Chrome Extension.

-Supporting a wide array of video formats.

-More accessibility features and customization.

-Making interface more user-friendly.
